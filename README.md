# Fullstack Modular Strategy Game ⚔️

A real-time multiplayer tactical strategy game built with a modular ability system. This project features a robust Node.js backend handling game logic, a React frontend for the interface, and Socket.io for seamless real-time synchronization between players.


## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Matchmaking queue and live gameplay via Socket.io.
- **Advanced Modular System**: Characters are dynamically built using interchangeable modules (Attack, Move, Teleport, Vampirism).
- **Persistent Game State**: Game sessions and queues are managed using a MySQL database.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns with dedicated layers for Listeners, Database Queries, and Game Logic.
- **State Management**: Frontend powered by Redux Toolkit for predictable UI updates.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Communication**: Socket.io (WebSockets)
- **Database**: MySQL (with custom SQL script integration)
- **Design Patterns**: Interface-based design, Module Pattern

**Frontend:**
- **Library**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (Slices)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Backend (`/server`)
Handles the "Source of Truth" for the game state.
- **`classes/`**: Core entities like `Room`, `Person`, and `BoardCell`.
- **`listeners/`**: Event handlers for socket actions (`play`, `useModule`, `resign`).
- **`database/`**: SQL-driven logic for matchmaking and session recovery.

### 2. Frontend (`/client`)
A modern React application.
- **`components/`**: Modular UI components (Board, Cell, SelectPersons).
- **`store/`**: Centralized game state management.
